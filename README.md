<h1 align="center">Guess Moo</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://guess-moo.herokuapp.com/)

Guess Moo is a Python terminal farm animal guessing game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.
The main goal of the game is for the program to guess the farm animal the player is thinking of in 20 questions or less.
This project was inspired by guessing games like Twenty Questions and Akinator.

-   ### <em>Manual Testing:</em>
This section will cover the manual testing of all the features of this application. The purpose of manual testing is to identify any potential bugs or issues in the application's functionalities. The following steps were repeated multiple times from early development. Print statements were used throughout the program to ensure everything functioned as intended.
The website was sent to as many friends, colleagues and family members as possible for testing and feedback.  
I played through the game countless times, seeking to uncover bugs and optimize user experience.

#### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

        2. The logo contains bright text intended to make it immediately clear that the purpose of this site is to play a guessing game.
        3. The game infomation section is the first item on the main menu, so that new users can quickly and easily get their heads around the aim of the game and how it works.

    2. As a Website Creator, I want to build a fun game that can be enjoyable for users of all ages.

        1. This game is simple enough for user's of all ages to understand and enjoy.
        2. I hope this game manages to capture at least a little bit of the sense of wonder and magic that Twenty Questions type games bring.

#### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Safari 
    browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop and multiple mobile 
    devices.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that every animal in the list could be guessed correctly.
-   A great amount of testing was done to ensure that there were no bugs affecting the gameplay.
-   Friends and family members were asked to play the game and provide feedback to point out any 
    bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Bugs
#### <em>Fixed:</em>
- I encountered a wealth of bugs and trials throughout the creation of this project, below I will detail a few.
- When I first got to the stage where the program could guess an animal, it returned the entire animal dictionary which was a simple fix, the "animal" key specifically had to be printed and not the animal dictionary with the highest probability.
- I also encountered an issue where the if a correct guess was made before 20 questions had been asked, the game loop continued asking questions until 20 was reached. I had to add break statements to fix this issue.
- When colorama colour codes were used alongside the typewriter function in extras.py, the colours would not display and numbers were printed before the string instead, I had to keep all typewriter text white to prevent this from happening.
- Another bug I encountered was that traits were being added to the asked list immediately after a question was generated, which caused problems if invalid input was received, the question was still considered asked and wouldn't be asked again, so I moved the code to append traits to the asked list to after valid user input is received.
- When the game ended the screen was clearing without displaying the game over menu, this was fixed by simply moving the clear function.

#### <em>Still Existing:</em>
- No known bugs at this time.
